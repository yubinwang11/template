A program coded in Python that analyzes the [Aviation Accident database][database]. It contains visualization and analysis of different trends in aviation accidents such as distribution of crashes across different countries, prediction of future trends in crashes. **This project was a part of MA0218 Introduction to Data Science and Artifical Intelligence.**

This project was my first dive into the world of data science and introduced me to popular libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. I learned the importance of cleaning data and effectively visualizing it. Finally, I implemented different machine learning models such as support vector machines and shallow neural networks using the Scikit-Learn library.
